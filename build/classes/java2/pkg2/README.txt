The main focus of the latest update to this project is the changes made in Lab 7,
where we added the GUI and the main menu with the UI. 

In addition to the UserUI, I worked on the AdminUI (core) and added a `JComboBox`
that allows the admin to make changes based on the selected user. 

This change also required an update to the LoginUI. 
The login now checks the company admin information and validates the admin username and password.

Note: Regarding Lab 8, I experienced a brief delay and couldn't upload my work on time. 
Therefore, I would like to include it here, as we were informed that those who couldn't upload the lab
could present their project with Assignment III.
(However, it is also accessible in the Lab 9 section.)
